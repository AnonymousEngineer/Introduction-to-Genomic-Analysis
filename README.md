# Introduction to Genomic Analysis Workshop Series
> This course is intended for Canadian researchers interested in learning the basic steps of genomic analysis using high performance computing. Using the computing resources of Compute Canada, specifically the WestGrid region, participants will work through practical exercises in the workshop sessions and receive a certificate of completion at the end of the series.

## General Course Information & Prerequisites
### Registering for the course
Please register for the course using our EventBrite Link [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/introduction-to-genomic-analysis-workshop-series-registration-33475860199)

### Course Format

> The course is intended for academic researchers at Canadian institutions in Western Canada, that have access to nationally supported Research Computing through Compute Canada, specifically the WestGrid branch.  

+ 2 hour workshops:
  + 45 minute lecture
  + 15 minute Q&A
  + 45 minute problemset
  + 15 wrap up
+ Each workshop has a prerequisite "quiz".  The problemset from the preceding workshop is the "quiz"
+ If you're familiar with a given subject, you just need to be able to complete the entry quiz instead of attending that subject
  + *Example 1*: Familiar with Linux, but want to learn about short read mapping, do the quiz for Session 2, and show up for Session 3. 
  + *Example 2*: Familiar with short read sequencing analysis and visualization, but want to learn about variant calling, do the quiz for Session 3 and show up to Session 4.
+ Each workshop will have local environment, hosted at BC Children's Hospital with refreshments provided
+ Each workshop will also have a virtual environment, hosted through Vidyo (See details on Vidyo [below](#Software-Installs) )

### Prerequisites  

#### Getting a Compute Canada WestGrid Account
