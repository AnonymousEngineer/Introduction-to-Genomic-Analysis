# ARC-Bioinformatics-Training
> This is the website for the UBC Advanced Research Computing Bioinformatics Training Initiative.  Our mission is to teach bioinformatics analysis and bring compute resources to researchers at UBC and across Canada.


## General Course Information & Prerequisites
The course is intended for academic researchers at Canadian institutions in Western Canada, that have access to nationally supported Research Computing through Compute Canada, specifically the WestGrid branch.  
+ **Prerequisites**
