All of these questions correspond to commands explained in the GEMINI slide deck:
https://speakerdeck.com/arq5x/an-introduction-and-tutorial-for-variant-exploration-with-gemini

All of these commands can be found in the github Gist.
1) Create a directory titled <LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME> inside of:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session5/Problemset/

2) Copy this file into your problemset directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session5/Problemset/Session5_Problemset.txt


3) Which samples/subjects are in your database?


4) Does the rest of the info match your pedigree file?


5) How many novel (i.e. not in dbSNP) are observed in these samples?


6) How many variants passed GATK filters?


7) How many variants are rare and in a disease-associated gene?


8) List those genes here:






9) At how many sites does subject 1805 have a non-reference allele?




10) At how many sites do subject 1805 and subject 4805 both have a non
reference allele?



11) How many  variants heterozygous in every sample? (note you have to count
them)


12) How many variants have at least 1 female homozygous for the alternate
allele?


13) How many variants have high quality genotypes for all samples
(aligned depth >= 50)?



14) Copy+paste the stats for these variants for the samples here:




15) Calculate the transition/transversion ratio and copy it here:



16) What is an amazing place you've traveled to (or lived in) outside of
Vancouver?
