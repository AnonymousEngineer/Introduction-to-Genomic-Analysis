This problem set will review the basic commands from the lecture, and add some new commands I didn't teach you (GASP!!!)

The examples in this problem set will also guide you through exploring different file formats commonly used in genomics.  
For help with file formats, use...the Internet!  Example: http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html 


1) Create a "Problemset directory" with your last name and first initial in all caps within:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session1/ProblemSet/

2) Copy this Session1 Problem set into your Problemset directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session1/ProblemSet/Session1_Problemset.txt

3) Copy this file into your Problemset directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session1/Files/genes.gtf

3) Rename the file to be called: hg38_genes.gtf

4) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "GRN", and save them in a file called GRN.gtf 

5) Double check your GRN.gtf to make sure it only has lines corresponding to GRN in it.  
If it doesn't, redo your command in #4 using the whole-word option from the grep command.

6) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "TTN", and save them in a file called TTN.gtf 

7) Delete the smaller of the two gtf files: GRN.gtf and TTN.gtf

8) Make a BED file (chromosome,start,stop tab separated) of the CDS entries for TTN called TTN.bed
